# Project Automation Script

## Overview

This script automates the process of generating a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet from a set of predefined configurations. Each configuration represents a project or a set of tasks with specific attributes like index, project, queue, template, name, start date, due date, ID, and zone. The script is designed to handle multiple configurations, including cases where multiple templates are applied to different index-ID pairs.

## Setup

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires Python 3.6 or later. You also need to install `pandas`, a powerful data manipulation and analysis package, which is used for creating and saving the Excel file.

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Pandas**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
````

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Define your configurations in the script. Each configuration should include the base data for the project and a list of entries. Each entry represents a task or item with specific attributes.

2. **Define Templates (if applicable)**: For configurations that require multiple templates applied to different index-ID pairs, define these templates and pairs within the script as shown in the `config3` example.

3. **Run the Script**: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run it using Python:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your script file.

4. **Check the Output**: After running the script, an Excel file named `output_combined.xlsx` will be generated in the same directory. This file contains all the configured data in a structured format.

## Customizing the Script

- **Adding or Modifying Configurations**: To add a new configuration or modify an existing one, adjust the `configurations` list in the script. Each configuration is a dictionary that contains `base_data` and `entries`.

- **Changing Output File Name**: To change the name of the output Excel file, modify the argument in the `df.to_excel("output_combined.xlsx", index=False)` function call.

## Support

For any questions or issues, refer to the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for detailed guidance on using the package, or consult Python-specific resources for general programming support.
